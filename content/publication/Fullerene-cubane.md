abstract = "The dynamics of fullerene-cubane C60-C8H8 cocrystal is studied combining experimental [x-ray diffuse scattering, quasielastic and inelastic neutron scattering (INS)] and simulation (molecular dynamics) investigations. Neutron scattering gives direct evidence of the free rotation of fullerenes and of the libration of cubanes in the high-temperature phase, validating the “rotor-stator” description of this molecular system. X-ray diffuse scattering shows that orientational disorder survives the order/disorder transition in the low-temperature phase, although the loss of fullerene isotropic rotational diffusion is featured by the appearance of a 2.2 meV mode in the INS spectra. The coupling between INS and simulations allows identifying a degeneracy lift of the cubane librations in the low temperature phase, which is used as a tool for probing the environment of cubane in this phase and for getting further insights into the phase transition mechanism."
