abstract = "This work is dedicated to the study of the structural and dynamical behavior of a model one-dimensional system over a wide temperature range : carbon nano-peapods. This compound is constituted of fullerenes (C60, in our case) inserted inside single-walled carbon nanotubes. The perfect match between the inner diameter of the tubes and the diameter of the fullerenes results in a chain organization of the C60 molecules. The synthesis of these peapods is described in the first part of this manuscript. The two next chapters are aimed to the description of the different experimental and simulation methods that are used to monitor the structural and dynamical behavior of the C60 molecules. In the three last chapters, we describe the behavior of the C60 molecules over three temperature ranges, labeled high (500–1100 K), low (0–200 K), and intermediary (200–500 K) ranges. By comparing experimental results to analytical models for both monomer and polymer peapods (the rotational degree of freedom being hindered in the latter), we highlight three different behaviors of the molecules in these three ranges."
