abstract = "We illustrate the contribution of inelastic neutron scattering to the understanding of the vibrations and lattice excitations of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, through some significant experimental results. Particular emphasis is placed on the study of intra and inter-molecular modes of fullerene C60, as well as on the order/disorder transition characteristic of these molecules. In addition, a significant part of this article is dedicated to various intercalation compounds of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes, such as the co-crystal 'fullerene-cubane' consisting of an arrangement of molecules of spherical and cubic shapes, or the compound called 'peapods', in which fullerene C60 are inserted inside carbon nanotubes."
