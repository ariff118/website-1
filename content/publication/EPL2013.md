abstract = "We report an in situ X-ray diffraction study of the high-temperature coalescence of C60 and C70 peapods. The monitoring of the structural evolution with time at two successive temperatures (1000ºC and 1200ºC) allows highlighting the occurrence of a two-step process for both peapods samples. The first step of the process, slower for C70 peapods than for C60 ones, is attributed to the transformation of individual molecules into corrugated tubules recalling the fullerenes one-dimensional periodicity. Even after long annealing time at 1000 ºC this transformation is found to stagnate, until the temperature is set higher than 1050ºC, where the corrugated tubules evolve into well-formed inner nanotubes."
