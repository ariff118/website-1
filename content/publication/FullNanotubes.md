abstract = "Fullerenes inserted in single-walled carbon nanotubes, the so-called 'peapods', provide scientists with an exceptional molecular model system to study one-dimensional physics and confinement. In this communication, we present recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements concerning the translational dynamics of this one-dimensional system. The recent synthesis of a large amount of two-dimensional oriented samples allows us to extract the sole contribution of the inserted C60 chains. The related quasi-elastic-like peak evolves with the temperature but never shows an additional inelastic contribution when lowering temperature, indicating that carbon peapod is a true one-dimensional system down to low temperatures."
