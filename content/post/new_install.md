_This is mainly for my own use, but I figured it might be useful to put it on-line..._

When changing computer, it's always a pain in the ass to set up your new machine like the old one. Over time, I tried to gather the different commands for installing the various programs I use to ease the setup of my next computer (or the update of my current one). You'll find the following entries on my [github page](https://github.com/colinbousige/New-Install), as well as my `.bash_profile` and my `.Rprofile` files.
