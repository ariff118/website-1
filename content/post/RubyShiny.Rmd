tags : ["R","Shiny"]
summary : Computing Pressure <--> Ruby Raman shift with a Shiny app
---

This is my first try as a Shiny app, I made it to help my students during their high pressure experiments using diamond anvil cell. It computes:  

- The pressure if you give it values of $\lambda_{laser}$, the R1 Raman shift at 0 pressure $\omega_0$, and the measured R1 Raman shift $\omega_{ruby}$  
- The expected Raman shift for the ruby, $\omega_{ruby}$, if you give it the other info  
- The pressure if you upload a ruby spectrum and give it the other info  

Either go on the Shiny server: https://cbousige.shinyapps.io/rubypressure/

Or run it directly in R with:
```
require(shiny)
runGitHub("RubyPressure","colinbousige")
```

Or clone the [repo](https://github.com/colinbousige/RubyPressure), `setwd()` to the folder where all the files are, and run it in R with:
```
require(shiny)
runApp()
```
I even went so far as providing a sample ruby spectrum: try it out!  
The laser wavelength for this experiment was 568.2 nm.
