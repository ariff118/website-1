# About me

Starting October 2017, I will be a CNRS researcher at the Laboratoire Multimatériaux et Interfaces in Lyon, principally working on the synthesis and the characterization of borophene. Apart from that, my interests include 1D and 2D nano-materials in general and carbon-based compounds in particular, as well as studying the effects of strong confinement in amorphous porous systems.
